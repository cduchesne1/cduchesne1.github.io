My team & I decided to develop a payment system working with digital prints. We created a registration system, a POS, payment terminal and a dashboard. To ensure the security of the system, we used AES & RSA to encode the data.\n\nThe project was developed under the MVC pattern. We implemented AES & RSA ourselves which was not easy to do with Java. We also used a Raspberry Pi to simulate the payment terminal.\n\nNote: The company mentioned in the video is a fictional company & the project is the sole property of the people who worked on it.","date":"February, 2020","gallery":[{"src":"/projects/credigit/credigit_preview_02.png","alt":"Credigit Preview 1"},{"src":"/projects/credigit/credigit_preview_03.png","alt":"Credigit Preview 2"},{"src":"/projects/credigit/credigit_preview_04.png","alt":"Credigit Preview 3"}],"techDescription":"The technologies used, were mostly chosen because of the experience of the team members with them.","technologies":["Java","JavaFX","MongoDB","Raspberry Pi"],"hasSite":false,"siteLink":"","hasRepo":true,"repoLink":"https://github.com/JLague/credigit","hasVideo":true,"videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1PWFaOfVV6Q","metaTitle":"Credigit"},"nextProjectData":{"thumbnail":{"src":"/projects/watchpoint/watchpoint_preview_01.png","alt":"Watchpoint Project Thumbnail"},"path":"watchpoint","title":"Watchpoint","description":"This project was my first real mobile project. Since I was learning Java in college, I decided to practice by learning Android development. After learning on the subject by watching courses, I decided to try to develop a project on my own.\n\nWatchpoint is a social network axed on events. Users can find events happening in their area, buy tickets, get directions & share their experience with other users.\n\nUnfortunately, this project was never finished but I would like to continue working on it in the future.","date":"June, 2019","gallery":[{"src":"/projects/watchpoint/watchpoint_preview_02.png","alt":"Watchpoint Preview 1"},{"src":"/projects/watchpoint/watchpoint_preview_03.png","alt":"Watchpoint Preview 2"},{"src":"/projects/watchpoint/watchpoint_preview_04.png","alt":"Watchpoint Preview 3"}],"techDescription":"This project was my first introduction to mobile development.
