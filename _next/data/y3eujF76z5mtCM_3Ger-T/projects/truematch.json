If two users like each other, they can chat.\n\nThis project was a real challenge for me. When starting it, I was used to work with Firebase and had little experience with REST APIs. I hit some limitations with Firebase and had no choice but to build a full REST API connected to a database to supply the mobile app.\n\n This project is probably the best self-learning experience I had. I was able to learn a lot about full-stack development & develop a passion for it.","date":"October, 2020","gallery":[{"src":"/projects/truematch/truematch_preview_02.png","alt":"TrueMatch Preview 1"},{"src":"/projects/truematch/truematch_preview_03.png","alt":"TrueMatch Preview 2"},{"src":"/projects/truematch/truematch_preview_04.png","alt":"TrueMatch Preview 3"}],"techDescription":"The technologies used for this project changed a lot during the development.
