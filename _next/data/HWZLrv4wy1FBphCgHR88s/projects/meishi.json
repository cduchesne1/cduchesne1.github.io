Many security best practices were included in the project such as CAPTCHA, throttling, encryption, input validation, cross-site scripting prevention & more.\n\nThis project was a great learning experience for me.

Me and my teammates searched a long time for a feasible, yet interesting, project to take on. We finally decided to develop a simplified version of Github.\n\nWhat I mean by a simplified version is that we didn't implement all the features of Github and instead of having a full-fledged SSH Git system, we used a simple Docker container with Git to manage the repositories. The backend interacted with the Git container using the Docker library.\n\nThis project was a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot about Docker, Git, and relational databases.","date":"April, 2022","gallery":[{"src":"/projects/repub/repub_preview_02.png","alt":"Repub Preview 1"},{"src":"/projects/repub/repub_preview_03.png","alt":"Repub Preview 2"},{"src":"/projects/repub/repub_preview_04.png","alt":"Repub Preview 3"}],"techDescription":"Since this project was developed for a university course, some of the technologies used were imposed by the course.","technologies":["Python","Flask","JavaScript","VueJS","Tailwind CSS","MySQL","Docker","Bash","Git"],"hasSite":false,"siteLink":"","hasRepo":true,"repoLink":"https://github.com/cduchesne1/GLO-2005-Repub","hasVideo":true,"videoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2xIt971sXr4?start=485","metaTitle":"Repub"}},"__N_SSG":true}
